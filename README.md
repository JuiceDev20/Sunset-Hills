#### Sunset Hills Challenge

![](/Images/SunsetHills-tile.png)

Another great challenge from Coder Foundry, you are putting me through the paces but I am learning tons. 
Good exercise to apply arrays and work on UI. It is amazing how our point of view can make things harder than they need to be. Solving these challenges requires a paradigm shift of sorts. Many people thinks developers just write code, but one can waist a lot of time typing if we do not understand the problem well and then can come up with the right solution for it. 
Anyway, hope you like using it and please feel free to share your thoughts. 


Enjoy your day!
