Sunset Hills Challenge

Another great challenge from Coder Foundry, you are putting me through the paces but I am learning tons.

Good exercise to apply arrays and work on UI. It is amazing how challenging our perception can make things 
harder than they need too be. This requires a paradigm shift of sorts.

Anyway, hope you like using it and please feel free to share your thoughts.
